A bar graph showing number of earthquakes across all continents since 1965 to 1988 (a realization of my second sketch) constructed using the [vega-lite-api](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api/).
The [Significant Earthquakes from 1965 dataset](https://gist.github.com/evarun22/318274dcc33d20b753516647310c41f3) has been used for this visualization.
This dataset contains information of earthquakes all over the world that took place from 1965.
Dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database).

The blank entry space on the list of Continents refers to earthquakes that have occurred in International Waters - boundaries of which do not belong to any particular country and hence are not indicated using any continent.
The range can be used to select the years which are to be visualized.

FUTURE WORK:
- Add a drop down to choose Continent(s)
