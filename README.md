# Earthquakes-Data-Visualization
A project that visualizes the earthquakes dataset that contains data about the significant earthquakes that ook place on earth since 1965.

## Data

This dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965. Dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a map that shows the occurences of earthquakes by latitude and longitude across the world since 1965. The depth of the color is represents the magnitude of that particular earthquake.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Top 10 years with highest number of earthquakes by number
 * Countries with most number of earthquakes
 * Countries with most dangerous earthquakes (magnitude more than 8)
 * Year wise average depth for earthquakes in a region (continent)
 * Count of Magnitude type by country and year

## Sketches

* The 1st sketch shows the occurrences of earthquakes all over the world with the size of the red circle representing magnitude
* The 2nd sketch shows the number of earthquakes by continent during different periods
* The 3rd sketch shows relationship between the variables Depth, Horizontal Distance and Magnitude
