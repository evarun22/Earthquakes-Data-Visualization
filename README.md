# Earthquakes-Data-Visualization
A project that visualizes the earthquakes dataset that contains data about the significant earthquakes that took place on earth since 1965.

## Data

This dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965. Dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a map that shows the occurences of earthquakes by latitude and longitude across the world since 1965. The depth of the color is represents the magnitude of that particular earthquake.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Countries with highest number of earthquakes by number
 * Countries with most dangerous earthquakes (magnitude more than 8)
 * Continents with the number of earthquakes in each period along with their magnitudes
 * Is there any Correlation between Horizontal distance, Magnitude and Depth?

## Sketches

* The 1st sketch shows the occurrences of earthquakes all over the world with the size of the red circle representing magnitude
  * I would like to include a tool tip that shows the name of the country when hovered upon
  * It will also include dropdown menus for FROM and TO by which the period can be selected
  * The size of the marker will represent magnitude
  * The darkness of color will represent the density
* The 2nd sketch shows the number of earthquakes by continent during different periods
  * It will have a filter to select only particular continent(s)
  * It will have a filter to select time period
  * It will have a feature to select a range for the number of earthquakes 
* The 3rd sketch shows relationship between the variables Depth, Horizontal Distance and Magnitude
  * Color will represent magnitude
  * Filters will be added to narrow the dataset down and have a closer look
  * Will help in understanding if there is a correlation among any of the three features
